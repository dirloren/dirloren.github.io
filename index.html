<h1>Dirk Lorenz' Live Streams</h1>

<p>
        As many people I am trying to get a hand on online teaching. I plan to record all my lectures (if lecture halls permitâ€¦), but I also want to have at least the possibility of live teaching and interaction with the students. My current solution is to stream from my laptop (via OBS studio) to Twitch and embed the Twitch stream here.
